Markdown Linter
Triggered by a Pull Request on the main branch
Makes use of the markdown-lint.yml and the customrules.js files, and will lint the README.md file present in the project's Top Level Directory and create a comment on the Pull Request with its body as any markdown formatting errors that are found or if there are none, then it will output 'Markdown Valid' as the body of the comment
The only change that may need to be made is if the README.md file is not in the Top Level Directory, then the file path value must be changed in markdown-lint.yml, line 21
Checkov Scan
Triggered by a Pull Request on the main branch
Makes use of the checkov.yml file, and will scan the Terraform code present in the directory for any security or compliance misconfigurations using graph-based scanning and will create a comment on the Pull Request with its body as the findings from the scan
No changes truly need to be made
